Introduction:
The Finance Dashboard is a web-based application developed using Django framework. It is designed to help organizations manage their financial data efficiently, including revenues, expenses, budgets, transactions, and investments. The system provides a user-friendly interface for data entry, visualization, and export functionalities.
